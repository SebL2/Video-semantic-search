## Setup
We recommend using VSCode: https://code.visualstudio.com/download

You may use an environment manager such as `conda` or `venv` if you'd like, but it is not required.

Use Poetry to install the requirements for this project.  You can install Poetry [here](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installing-with-the-official-installer).
```bash
poetry install
```
